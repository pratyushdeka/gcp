Cloud Storage
- A service that offers developers and IT organizations durable and highly available object storage
- What is object storage?
	- Object storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as "objects" and not as a file and folder hierarchy (file storage), or as chunks of a disk (block storage)
	- These objects are stored in a packaged format which contains
		- Binary form of the actual data itself
		- Relevant associated meta-data (such as date created, author, resources type, and permissions)
		- Globally unique identifier
	- These unique keys are in the form of URLs, which means object storage interacts well with web technologies
	- Data commonly stored as objects include
		- Video
		- Pictures
		- Audio recording
- Google's object storage product
- Allows customers to store any amount of data, and to retrieve it as often as needed
- Fully managed scalable service that has a wide variety of users
- Examples: 
	- Serving website content
	- Storing data for archival and disaster recovery
	- Distributing large data objects to end users via Direct Download
- Primary Use:
	- Binary large-object (BLOB) storage needed for 
		- Online content
		- Backup and archiving data
		- Storage of intermediate results in processing workflows
- Cloud storage files are organized into buckets
	- A bucket needs a 
		- globally unique name
		- a specific geographic location for where it should be stored
		- an ideal location for a bucket is where latency is minimized
		- For example: if most of the application users are in Europe, probably pick a European location
			- a specific Google cloud region
			- EU multi-region
- Cloud storage objects are immutable
	- objects are not edited
	- new version is created with every change made
	- administrators have option to allow object versioning or not
		- If object versioning is enabled, then Cloud Storage will keep a detailed history of modifications
			- list the archived versions of an object
			- restore an object to an older state
			- permanently delete a version of an object
		- If not enabled, then new versions will always overwrite older versions
- Controlling access to stored data is essential to ensuring security and privacy are maintained. There are couple of options to control user access to objects and buckets
	- Cloud IAM is sufficient for most purposes
		- Roles are inherited from project to bucket to object
	- Create access control lists (ACL) if finer control needed
		- Scope - defines who can access and perform an action (can be a specific user or group of users )
		- Permission - defines what actions can be performed, like read or write
- Cloud Storage also offers lifecycle management policies
	- Examples:
		- Deletes objects older than 365 days
		- Delete objects create before 1st January 2025
		- Keep on the 3 most recent versions
