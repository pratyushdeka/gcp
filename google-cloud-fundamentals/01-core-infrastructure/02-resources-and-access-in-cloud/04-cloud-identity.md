With Cloud Identity, organizations can define policies and manage their users and groups using the Google Admin Console. 

Admins can log in and manage Google Cloud resources using the same usernames and passwords they already use in existing Active Directory or LDAP systems.

Google Admin Console can be used to disable user accounts and remove them from groups when they leave.
