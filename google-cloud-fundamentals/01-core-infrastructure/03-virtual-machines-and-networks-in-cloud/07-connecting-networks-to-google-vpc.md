Many Google Cloud customers want to connect their Google Virtual Private Cloud networks to other networks in their system, such as on-premises networks or networks in other clouds.
There are several effective ways to accomplish this
- Cloud VPN
	- Uses Cloud Router to make the connection dynamic
	- Lets other networks and Google VPC, exchange route information over the VPN using the Border Gateway Protocol
	- Using this method, if you add a new subnet to your Google VPC, your on-premises network will automatically get routes to it
	- Not always the best option because of security concerns or bandwidth reliability
- Direct Peering
	- Puts a router in the same public data center as a Google point of presence
	- Uses a router to exchange traffic between networks
	- More than 100 Google points of presence around the world
- Career Peering
	- Customers who aren’t already in a point of presence can work with a partner in the Carrier Peering program to get connected
	- Gives you direct access from on-premises network through a service provider's network to Google
	- Not covered by a Google Service Level Agreement
- Dedicated Interconnect
	- getting the highest uptimes for interconnection
	- Allows for one or more direct, private connections to Google
	- Can be covered by up to a 99.99% SLA
	- Connections can be backed up by a VPN
- Partner Interconnect
	- Provides connectivity between an on-premises network and a VPC network through a supported service provider
	- Useful if a data center is in a physical location that can't reach a Dedicated Interconnect colocation facility
	- Useful if the data needs don’t warrant an entire 10 GigaBytes per second connection
	- Depending on availability needs, Partner Interconnect can be configured to support mission-critical services or applications that can tolerate some downtime
	- Can be covered by up to a 99.99% SLA
- Cross-Cloud Interconnect
	- Establish high-bandwidth dedicated connectivity between Google Cloud and another cloud service provider
	- Supports the adoption of an integrated multi-cloud strategy
	- Offers reduced complexity, site-to-site data transfer, and encryption
	- Two connections sizes: 10Gbps or 100Gbps
