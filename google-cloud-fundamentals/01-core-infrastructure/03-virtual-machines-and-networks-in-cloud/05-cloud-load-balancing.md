How do your customers get to your application when it might be provided by four VMs one moment, and by 40 VMs at another? That's done through Cloud Load Balancing.

Cloud Load Balancing
- The job of a load balancer is to distribute user traffic across multiple instances of an application. By spreading the load, load balancing reduces the risk that applications experience performance issues
- Cloud Load Balancing is a fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all your traffic
- You can put Cloud Load Balancing in front of all of your traffic: 
	- HTTP or HTTPS
	- TCP traffic
	- SSL traffic
	- UDP traffic
- Provides cross-region load balancing, including automatic multi-region failover, which gently moves traffic in fractions if backends become unhealthy
- Reacts quickly to changes in users, traffic, network, backend health, and other related conditions
- No so-called “pre-warming” is required for anticipated spikes in traffic

Google Cloud offers a range of load balancing solutions that can be classified based on the OSI model layer they operate at and their specific functionalities
- Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS) - Layer 7
	- Operate at the application layer and are designed to handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic
	- Ideal for web applications and services that require advanced features like content-based routing and SSL/TLS termination
	- Operate as reverse proxies, distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend instances based on rules you define
	- Highly flexible and can be configured for both internet-facing (external) and internal applications
	- Types:
		- External
			- Global external Application Load Balancer
			- Regional external Application Load Balancer
		- Internal
			- Regional internal Application Load Balancer
			- Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
- Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP/other IP protocols) - Layer 4
	- Operate at the transport layer and efficiently handle TCP, UDP, and other IP protocols
	- Further classified into two Types
		- Proxy Network Load Balancers
			- Also function as reverse proxies, terminating client connections and establishing new ones to backend services
			- Offer advanced traffic management capabilities and support backends located both on-premises and in various cloud environments
			- Types
				-  External
					- Global external proxy Network Load Balancer
					- Regional external proxy Network Load Balancer
				- Internal
					- Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
					- Cross-region internal proxy Network Load Balancer
		- Passthrough Network Load Balancers
			- do not modify or terminate connections
			- instead directly forward traffic to the backend while preserving the original source IP address
			- well-suited for applications that require direct server return or need to handle a wider range of IP protocols
			- Types
				- External
					- Regional
						- Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
				- Internal
					- Regional
						- Regional internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
