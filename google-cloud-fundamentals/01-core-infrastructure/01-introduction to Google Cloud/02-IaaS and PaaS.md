Two types of Offerings
- IaaS
	- IaaS offerings provide raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers
		- Compute Engine is an example of Google cloud IaaS service
		- Customers pay for the resources allocated ahead of time
- PaaS
	- PaaS offerings bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs
	- Allows more resources to be focused on application logic
	- App engine is an example of GCP PaaS service
	- Customers pay for the resources they actually use
- SaaS
	- provides the entire app stack, delivering an entire cloud-based apps that customers can access and use
	- SaaS apps run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by end users
	- E.g. Gmail, Docs, and Drive

As the cloud computing has evolved, the momentum shifted towards 
- managed infrastructure
- managed services
Leveraging managed infrastructure and services allows companies to focus more on business goals and spend less time and money on creating and maintaining their technical infrastructure.
It allows companies to deliver products and services to their customers more quickly and reliably

Serverless cloud computing
- Allows developers to concentrate on their code, rather than on server configuration, by eliminating the need for nay infrastructure management.
	- Cloud Run
		- Allows customers to deploy their containerised microservices based apps in a fully managed environment
	- Cloud Functions
		- manages event driven code as pay-as-you go service
