		- measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to destination
- Each location is divided into several different regions and zones
- Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones
- E.g. London or europe-west2 is a region that currently comprises three different zones
- A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed. E.g europe-west2-a, europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c
- Multi-region: Spanner multi-regions configurations allow you to replicate the database's data not just in multiple zones, but in multiple zones across multiple regions, as defined by the instance configuration
