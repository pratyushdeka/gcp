Cloud Computing Overview
	What is Cloud? (Definition by US NIST)
		- Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that have these five equally important traits
			- Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
				- Through a web UI, users get the processing power, storage and network they require w/o the need for human intervention
			- Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere
			- The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
				- Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources
			- Resources are elastic - which means they're flexible, so customers can be
				- Customers can get as many resources they want
			- Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go
	Why Cloud model compelling nowadays?
		- First wave - Colocation
			- Colocation gave users the financial efficiency of renting physical space. instead of investing in data center real estate
		- Second wave - Virtualised Data center
			- share similarities with the private data centers and colocation facilities
			- components of virtualised data centers match the physical building blocks of hosted  computing - servers, CPUs, disks, load balancers, and so-on but they are virtual devices
			- With virtualisation, enterprises still maintain the infrastructure, but it also remains user-controlled and user-configured environment
		- Third wave - Container-based architecture
			- A fully automated, elastic third wave cloud that consists of a combination of automated services and scalable data
			- Services automatically provision and configure the infrastructure used to run applications
		- Fourth wave - Google cloud offering third-wave available to Google customers
