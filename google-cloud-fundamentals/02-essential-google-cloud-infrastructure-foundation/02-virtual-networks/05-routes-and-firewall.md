Cloud Routes
- A route is a mapping of an IP range to a destination
	- Every network has:
		- Routes that let instances in a network send traffic directly to each other, even across subnets
		- A default route that directs packets to destinations that are outside the network
	- __Firewall__ rules must also allow the packet
- Routes map traffic to destination networks
	- Apply to traffic egressing a VM
	- Forward traffic to most specific route
	- Are created when a subnet is created
	- Enable VMs on same network to communicate
	- Destination is in CIDR notation
	- Traffic is delivered only if ti also matches a firewall rule

Cloud Firewall Rules
- Firewall rules protect your VM instances form unapproved connections, both inbound and outbound, known as ingress and egress, respectively
	- Every VPC network functions as a distributed firewall
	- Firewall rules are applied to the network as a whole
	- Connections are allowed or denied at the instance level
	- GCP firewall rules are stateful
		- Firewall rules allow bidirectional communication once a session is established
	- Implied deny all ingress and allow all egress
	- A firewall rule is composed of the following parameters 
		- direction
			- Inbound connections are matched against **ingress** rules only
			- Outbound connections are matched against **egress** rules only
		- source or destination
			- For the **ingress** direction, **sources** can be specified as part of the rule with IP addresses, source tags or a source service account
			- For the **egress** direction, **destinations** can be specified as part of the rule with one or more range of IP addresses
		- protocol and port
			- Any rule can be restricted to apply to specific protocols only or specific combinations of protocols and ports only
		- action
			- To allow or deny packets that match the direction, protocol, port, and source or destination of the rule
		- priority
			- Governs the order in which rules are evaluated; the first matching rule is applied
		- Rule assignment
			- All rules are assigned to all instances, but you can assign certain rules to certain instances only
- Google Cloud firewall use case: Egress
	- Egress firewall rules control outgoing connections originated inside GCP network
	- Conditions:
		- Destination CIDR ranges
		- Protocols
		- Ports
	- Action
		- Allow: permit the matching egress connection
			- Egress allow rules allow outbound connections that match specific protocol, ports, and IP addresses
		- Deny: block the matching egress connection
			- Egress deny rules prevent instances from initiating connections that match non-permitted port, protocol, and IP range combinations
	- For egress firewall rules, destinations to which a rule applies may be specified using IP CIDR ranges
- Google Cloud firewall use case: Ingress
	- Ingress firewall rules protect against incoming connections to the instance from any source
	- Ingress allow rules allow specific protocol, ports, and IP ranges to connect in
	- Conditions:
		- Destination CIDR ranges
		- Protocols
		- Ports
	- Action
		- Allow: permit the matching ingress connection
		- Deny: block the matching ingress connection
	- control ingress connections from a VM instance by constructing inbound connection conditions using source CIDR ranges, protocols, or ports
