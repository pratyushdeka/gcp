In Google Cloud, each virtual machine can have two IP addresses assigned
- Internal IP
	- Allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP
	- DHCP lease is renewed every 24hrs
	- VM name + IP is registered with network-scoped DNS
		- it can translate web URLs and VM names of hosts in the same network. but can't translate host names from VMs in a different network
- External IP (optional)
	- Assign external IP address if the machine is externally facing
	- Assigned from
		- Pool (ephemeral)
		- Reserved external IP address (static)
			- charged higher if not assigned to a resource or a forwarding rule
	- Bring your own IP address (BYOIP)
	- VM doesn't know external IP; it is mapped to the internal IP
