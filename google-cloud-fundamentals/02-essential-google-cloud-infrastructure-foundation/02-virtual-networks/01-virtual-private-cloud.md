Google Cloud uses a software-defined network, that is built on a global fiber infrastructure. 

With Google Cloud, you can provision your Google Cloud resources, connect them to each other, and isolate them from each other in a Virtual Private Cloud. You can also define fine-grained networking policies within Google Cloud, and between Google Cloud and on-premises or other public clouds. VPC is a comprehensive set of Google-managed networking objects.
